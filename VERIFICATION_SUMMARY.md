---

## ✅ Requirement 4: Mock OTP
**Status: COMPLETE** ✅

**What's Present:**

### Web Application:
- File: `frontend/src/KycPage.tsx`
- Lines: 103-152
- OTP input interface (6-digit)
- Auto-focus between fields
- Resend OTP button
- Mock validation

### Mobile Application:
- File: `mobile/src/screens/KycScreen.tsx`
- Lines: 97-135

**Mock OTP Values:**
```javascript
VOTER1 → 123456
VOTER2 → 234567
VOTER3 → 345678
VOTER4 → 456789
Default → 123456 (for any other voter ID)
```

**How It Works:**
1. User enters Voter ID
2. System shows OTP input (no actual SMS sent)
3. User enters the predefined OTP for that voter
4. System validates against hardcoded values
5. On success, proceeds to face verification

**Implementation Details:**
- Client-side validation
- No real SMS gateway (mock only)
- Helpful error messages showing expected OTP
- Debug logging for troubleshooting

---

## ✅ Requirement 5: Microservice for Voter ID Verification
**Status: COMPLETE** ✅

**What's Present:**
- Express.js backend server
- Runs on port 3001
- Two main API endpoints

**Location:** `backend/server.js` (122 lines)

**API Endpoints:**

### 1. KYC Verification Endpoint
```
GET /api/kyc?voter_id=VOTER1
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "eligible": true,
  "address": "0x90F79bf6EB2c4f870365E785982E1f101E93b906"
}
```

**What it does:**
- Receives voter ID from frontend
- Queries `backend/kyc-data.json` database
- Returns eligibility status and Ethereum address
- Handles errors and invalid voter IDs

**Implementation:** Lines 66-77

### 2. Merkle Proof Endpoint
```
GET /api/merkle-proof?voter_id=VOTER1
```

**Response:**
```json
[
  "0x1234...",
  "0x5678...",
  "0xabcd..."
]
```

**What it does:**
- Generates cryptographic Merkle proof
- Proves voter is in eligible voter list
- Used for on-chain verification
- Implements Merkle tree algorithm

**Implementation:** Lines 80-118

**Features:**
- ✅ CORS enabled
- ✅ Helmet.js security headers
- ✅ Rate limiting (60 requests/minute)
- ✅ Input sanitization
- ✅ Merkle tree generation
- ✅ Error handling

**Mock Database:**
```json
// backend/kyc-data.json
[
  { "voterId": "VOTER1", "address": "0x90F79..." },
  { "voterId": "VOTER2", "address": "0x0000..." },
  { "voterId": "VOTER3", "address": "0x0000..." },
  { "voterId": "VOTER4", "address": "0x8626..." }
]
```

**How to Test:**
```bash
# Start backend
cd backend
npm start

# Test KYC endpoint
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/kyc?voter_id=VOTER1"

# Test Merkle proof endpoint
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/merkle-proof?voter_id=VOTER1"
```

## ⚠️ Requirement 6: Webcam Check
**Status: PARTIALLY COMPLETE** ⚠️

### ✅ Web Application: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

**File:** `frontend/src/components/FaceRecognition.tsx` (233 lines)

**What's Present:**
- Real webcam access via `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`
- Face detection using `face-api.js` library
- TinyFaceDetector model
- Consecutive frame verification (5 frames)
- Camera permission handling
- Error handling with fallback

**How It Works:**
1. Component loads face detection models
2. Requests camera access from user's browser
3. Streams video to HTML5 `<video>` element
4. Runs detection loop on each video frame
5. Detects faces with confidence threshold (0.5)
6. Requires 5 consecutive positive detections
7. Calls `onVerified()` callback on success

**Technical Details:**
- Library: face-api.js
- Model: TinyFaceDetector (lightweight, fast)
- Resolution: 640x480
- Detection threshold: 0.5 (50% confidence)
- Verification frames: 5 consecutive
- Model loading: Local + CDN fallback

**Integration:**
- Used in `frontend/src/KycPage.tsx` (lines 360-384)
- Triggered after OTP verification
- Displayed in modal dialog
- Shows live webcam feed

**Demo/Fallback Mode:**
- If models fail to load: falls back to auto-verify
- If camera unavailable: shows error message
- Test environment: auto-verifies instantly
- Useful for demos without actual face detection

**Browser Support:**
- ✅ Chrome
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Edge
- ✅ Safari (with permissions)

### ⚠️ Mobile Application: DEMO MODE ONLY

**File:** `mobile/src/components/FaceRecognition.tsx` (75 lines)

**What's Present:**
- Simulated camera initialization
- Manual verification button
- "Demo Mode" message

**Current State:**
- ❌ No real camera integration
- ❌ No face detection library
- ✅ Simulates 2-second loading
- ✅ Manual "Continue" button

**Why Limited:**
- React Native requires native camera libraries
- Need `react-native-camera` or `react-native-vision-camera`
- Requires Android/iOS permission configuration
- Face detection needs ML Kit or Vision API
- More complex setup than web

**To Add Real Camera:**
```bash
npm install react-native-vision-camera
npm install react-native-face-detection

# Then update permissions in:
# - android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
# - ios/Info.plist
```
